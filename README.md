### About Me

I'm a web developer with a background in small business, project management, and construction. Although I've always had a strong interest in computers and tech since childhood, I discovered my passion for programming while running my small but successful exterior remodeling company.

I created this web app as my capstone project while taking the 6-month web development course there.
